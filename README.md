# Beerstore (Quesale)

Just beerstores module (serverless) from **quesale proyect** from year 2017.

## Getting Started

*Quesale* was a community service such that spread diferents event on Alto Valle's region. Those event was organized by people who didn't have webpage, or any app service.
Finally a beer store's module was included to help people to find the closer ones to them.
All this, with the interactive map location to facility user experience.
On the begining this was a proyect with backend technologies like DRF, Flask, etc. Implementing API and web server.
Frontend was implementing with Redux/React, using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap services.
This repository is just one module from that proyect, and serverless one, just to expose my first steps on Redux/React, and the combination of differents services and libreries.

### VERSION 1
On this repository the idea was only work with the react's new version (at 2020). Once again, just the QueSales's beerstores module. So, this project was bootstrapped with Create React App. **The challenge** is **only** use React and its hooks **(No Redux and useReduce this time)**.
To make this proyect more good looking, I'll use material ui.
